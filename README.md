# trump-tweet-pred-text
Notebook with step-by-step NLP pipeline, with LSTM network that learns to predict text based on a small corpus.

Unless you want to train this model from scratch (which I do not recommend), you can find the model here:

Download it directly to the working directory and run the notebook cell that loads the model; from there, you can run your own predictions.
